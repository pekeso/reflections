1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new sub-directory named .git/ is created and added to the repository.
You need to do it before you can use that directory as a git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging is like a transitional place holder between the working directory and the
repository. 
It offers a great opportunity to revisit what we have to commit and if by mistake we
commited a file we never intended to, we can easily remove that file from the staging
area.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the git diff --staged command to verify that the change we made is a logical 
change as compared to the last commit.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

- In trying out an experimental feature while keeping the original safe
- In adding a new language 
Branches help keep having the original file unchanged while we have the freedom to 
experiment on new stuffs.

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps by seeing the number of branches we have and how they are inter-related.
It also helps visualizing the history for each branch and see if there are commits
that don't affect any branch.

6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result brings together the commits that were on the two branches
