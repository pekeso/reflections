1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new sub-directory named .git/ is created and added to the repository.
You need to do it before you can use that directory as a git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging is like a transitional place holder between the working directory and the
repository. 
It offers a great opportunity to revisit what we have to commit and if by mistake we
commited a file we never intended to, we can easily remove that file from the staging
area.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the git diff --staged command to verify that the change we made is a logical 
change as compared to the last commit.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

- In trying out an experimental feature while keeping the original safe
- In adding a new language 
Branches help keep having the original file unchanged while we have the freedom to 
experiment on new stuffs.
