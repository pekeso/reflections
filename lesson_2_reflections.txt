1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new sub-directory named .git/ is created and added to the repository.
You need to do it before you can use that directory as a git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging is like a transitional place holder between the working directory and the
repository. 
It offers a great opportunity to revisit what we have to commit and if by mistake we
commited a file we never intended to, we can easily remove that file from the staging
area.
