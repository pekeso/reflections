When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I have to collaborate with people or just make my project available to
the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to be in control of the local repository should look like.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

 - fork: only works on GitHub servers
 - clone: works from GitHub server to local repo or from local repo to local
 - branch: works on commits both locally and on GitHub servers

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It's always great to compare the last working state of the project when
collaborating.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It would have been very difficult
We would have a local server and use VPN or file sharing on the internet

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When working on a new feature and want to share it with the team.
